I am a DevOps Engineer with experience in deploying and managing infrastructure using HashiCorp Terraform and Jenkins. Proficient in AWS services such as CloudWatch, S3, DynamoDB, VPC, EC2, IAM Users & Roles, Lambda and serverless architecture. Skilled in using Docker and Kubernetes for container orchestration.

In addition to my technical skills, I am also well-versed in Agile methodologies and use tools such as Jira to manage and track tasks and projects. I understand the importance of clear and concise documentation and use Confluence to document processes and procedures. This helps ensure that all team members have a clear understanding of what needs to be done, how it needs to be done, and when it needs to be done.

I am passionate about technology and the role it plays in enabling businesses to achieve their goals. I am excited to continue to grow my career in the field of DevOps and look forward to contributing to the success of future projects and teams.
